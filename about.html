  Hi everyone.  I don’t know about you guys, but as a professional illustrator, graphic designer, and art director in Chicago, I hate most of the digital art that’s been uploaded over the last two decades for the Grateful Dead’s live concerts.  I was really frustrated at the turn of the millennium seeing the hundreds of live Dead and Jerry Garcia I digitally converted and transferred with no cover art when iTunes came out.  Being an oldster and an old LP collector, I’ve always loved album covers.  And I missed not seeing something visual for my shows.  So I decided twenty-three years ago I would professionally design my own covers for myself.
<br><br>
For many of you who also collect live jamband music, I’m sure you’ve seen a lot of cover art that is circulating on the internet.  But as far as I’m concerned, most of it is just plain bad.
<br><br>
And when I mean bad, I mean godawful bad - terrible bad - garbage bad with the art having everything wrong with it -  formulaic and repetitious, bad concept, bad composition, amateurish technique; and art that’s irrelevant to the city the band is in or the venue they are playing at with little context to the events of the day.  And the worst of all, there is little or no humor, wit, irony, or satire in the designs.  Well, I’m changing that with each design having been carefully created with actual thought, time, and an educated, artisic vision put into them.
<br><br>
For twenty-three years, I've collected hundreds of original concert poster jpegs and the world’s strongest and boldest graphics; the funniest cartoons; the best comic magazine and book covers; the coolest fractals; the most beautiful etchings and engravings, as well as history’s greatest fine artists and illustrators for an excellent variety of subject matters and artistic styles.  I’ve gone through at least a million (probably two million) images that include postage stamps, old vegetable crate labels, post cards, antique greeting cards, original graphics, etc., for the 2,300 shows the Boyz did.
<br><br>
And if that wasn’t enough, I chose the seemingly impossible goal of never using the same font twice to create a library of unique, iconic, and unforgettable images that can be easily recognized in your computer, phone, iPod, or in your car’s digital dash.  Because when you have five or six hundred shows like I have, sometimes you’re not exactly sure which one you’re listening to (although it’s sure fun to guess).  
<br><br>
I started collecting all these images at the turn of the millennium - collecting and cataloging jpegs for the first ten years - only beginning to assign and design covers after that ten year organizational search had matured (I’m always finding new stuff).  And I like to think that I now have the best sonic and visual music library in the world.  That was the goal I set for myself and for my friends, twenty-three years ago. 
<br><br>
But in the summer of 2015, everything changed when the Dead had their 50th anniversary concerts at Soldier Field.  I read a Chicago Tribune newspaper article that weekend that said 600,000 letter requests for tickets were sent to the San Rafael ticket office for the three night run.  I thought that was crazy!  But it gave me the idea to continue uploading all the original concert posters I could find and my own work to complete the project by doing covers of the entire thirty year catalog. So for the last seven years, I’ve been focusing on designing the other 1600-1800 shows.
<br><br>
I have also added a concert review section for the shows collected and /or previously reviewed on The Archive to help newbies find the best Dead and Garcia performances.  I want this to be the coolest website next to The Archive.com, etree.com and Dead.net.  I hope everyone likes what I’ve done.  Because only the best art in the world should cover the greatest shows on earth!  And now these 200 DPI by 900 x 900 pixel concert covers are all free for you.
<br><br>
I think my concert art would make a great gift for the serious collector.  I’m also working on a donation page and a store for signed prints that can be had of all the vignettes I’ve created. So stay tuned!   Thanks.
